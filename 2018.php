                <h2>Bloom: Bible Talks From Psalm 1</h2><br>
                <h3>Talk 1 – The Good Life</h3>
                <p>We all want to live “the good life”.
                    But what does that mean? How do we know we have got it right?
                    And what happens if you get it wrong?
                    Digging into Psalm 1 we discover there is indeed a right way and a wrong way to live – and it’s a matter of life or death.</p>
                <h3>Talk 2 – A Well-Watered Tree</h3>
                <p>Digging deeper still, we examine the central image of Psalm 1 – the well-watered tree.
                    God’s promises here are both a comfort and a challenge.  How will we respond?</p>
