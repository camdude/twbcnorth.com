                <h2>Staying Strong in the Lord</h2><br>
                <p>As the years roll on, the distractions of this world, uncertainties in life and the challenges to our worldview can consume us and cause our faith to drift.
                    Complacency can pull us away. How can we stay strong, and grow even stronger in our love for Jesus?
                    How do we nurture our souls and draw closer to our Lord?
                    The Psalms will guide and inspire us as we seek to live for Jesus each day.</p>

                <img src="resources/images/speaker19.jpg" alt="Chris Quirk" width="197" height="295" style="margin: 5px; float: left;">
                <p>Chris trained as a primary school teacher and when the suggestion of learning to preach was given, Chris decided to study at SMBC to ground her theology and develop her pastoral skills.
                    Chris has recently retired from teaching Biblical Studies.
                    As well as new opportunities for ministry, she is looking forward to discovering more of Australia with her husband Mick, spending time with grandchildren and dabbling in more learning at Bible College.
                    She enjoys family picnics and is refreshed by a relaxed cup of tea with friends.</p>
