                <h2>Women Who Pray</h2><br>
                <p>Does prayer make a difference? How should I pray? What should I pray for? Is there a right and wrong way to pray? Will God hear my prayers? Why is prayer so difficult at times?
                    Ladies these are questions that many of us struggle with at times, so come join us as we look to the bible to help us think through these questions.</p><br>

                <p>Elizabeth Poland will be our guest speaker for TWBC 2016.
                    She has lived in beautiful Tasmania for 14 years.
                    Elizabeth works as a school chaplain, is a mother to 4 children and was widowed at the very young age of 46.
                    She has learnt much in the last 5 years since her husband James died.
                    Elizabeth really looks forward to sharing the Bible with us.
                    She particularly loves all things chocolate and describes herself as a lazy pray-er.</p>
