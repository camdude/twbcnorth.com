                <h2>Staying Strong in the Lord</h2>
                <p>As the years roll on, the distractions of this world, uncertainties in life and the challenges to our worldview can consume us and cause our faith to drift.
                    Complacency can pull us away. How can we stay strong, and grow even stronger in our love for Jesus?
                    How do we nurture our souls and draw closer to our Lord?
                    The Psalms will guide and inspire us as we seek to live for Jesus each day.</p><br>

                <h2>Bloom: Bible Talks From Psalm 1</h2>
                <p><b>The Good Life: </b>We all want to live “the good life”.
                    But what does that mean? How do we know we have got it right?
                    And what happens if you get it wrong?
                    Digging into Psalm 1 we discover there is indeed a right way and a wrong way to live – and it’s a matter of life or death.</p>
                <p><b>A well-watered Tree: </b>Digging deeper still, we examine the central image of Psalm 1 – the well-watered tree.
                    God’s promises here are both a comfort and a challenge.  How will we respond?</p><br>

                <h2>Great Expectations: Destruction, Disapointment and Hope</h2>
                <p>There is sadness and hope in Haggai, we see Israel’s story of destruction and disappointment met with promises of a glorious future.
                    As we trace their story we will see that this small post-exilic prophet has a profound message for our own experiences of disappointment and hope today.</p><br>

                <h2>Women Who Pray</h2>
                <p>Does prayer make a difference? How should I pray? What should I pray for? Is there a right and wrong way to pray? Will God hear my prayers? Why is prayer so difficult at times?
                    Ladies these are questions that many of us struggle with at times, so come join us as we look to the bible to help us think through these questions.</p><br>

                <h2>The Essential Wardrobe</h2>
                <p>This year we especially invite teenage girls, young mums and women of all ages.
                    Together we will explore what the Bible tells us about The Essential Wardrobe; what it looks like and how we might use it while living in the 21st century.</p><br>
